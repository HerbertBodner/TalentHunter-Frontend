# TalentHunter

The goal of this project is to learn the concepts of Angular4.
Therefore, IÂ´m going to build an Angular4 application, which I called TalentHunter. 

It can be used to keep track of candidates, who apply for a job position and rate them based on how good they match with the role description.
At the moment all the data is mocked, but the idea is to finally build also a .Net backend system with a database and connect it to the frontend via APIs.
